📌 Project Overview

The Email Spam Classifier is a Machine Learning–based application that detects whether an email/message is Spam or Not Spam (Ham).
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text and a trained ML model to make predictions.

This project helps in filtering unwanted or malicious emails automatically.
